      <h2>Market history</h2>
      <p>
        The Fresh Farmers Market was founded in 2008 by a group of local farmers
        who wanted to create a platform to sell their fresh produce directly to consumers.
        The market started with just 10 vendors and operated out of a small parking lot in the city.
      </p>
      <p>Over the years, the market grew in popularity, and by 2012,
        it had expanded to 30 vendors and moved to a larger location. In 2015,
        the market became a certified non-profit organization,
        allowing it to receive grants and donations to support its operations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, the Fresh Farmers Market is one of the largest and most popular farmers'markets in the region, with over 50 vendors selling a wide variety of fresh produce,
        meats, dairy products, baked goods, and prepared foods.
